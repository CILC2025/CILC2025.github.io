### Accomodation Support for Junior Participants
The Italian Association for Logic Programming is offering a limited number of free shared accommodations (same-gender rooms) for two nights — June 25th and 26th — during CILC 2025. 
We particularly welcome requests from Master's students, PhD students, and early-career postdocs.
Participants interested in this support are kindly invited to complete the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/g14aP6Ng7xdezi4d7) as soon as possible.
