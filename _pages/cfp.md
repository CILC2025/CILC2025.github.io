# Submission Guidelines

The Conference solicits two types of submissions:
- Full papers, even if already published in journals or in proceedings of other conferences
- Short papers, which are particularly suitable to present work in progress, software prototypes, extended abstracts of doctoral thesis, and general overviews of research projects.

Contributions must be written in English, formatted using the CEURART style ([with the one-column option](https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html#CEURART)), and submitted in PDF format.
See CEUR author instructions for further details on how to prepare your submission.

Full papers cannot exceed 15 pages including references. Short papers cannot exceed 8 pages including references. 
Non-original contributions should include a reference to the already published version of the paper (for instance in a footnote on the first page).

Papers must be submitted via Easychair: TBA

# Proceedings

Accepted original contributions will be included in a volume of the [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](https://ceur-ws.org/).<br>
Accepted non-original contributions will be given visibility on the conference web site including a link to the original publication, if available.
**For each paper accepted, at least one of the authors is required to make a senior registration (details will be available soon on the web site).**

Following the CILC tradition, a selection of papers is planned to be published in a special issue of an international journal (to be determined). 
Extensions of accepted non-original contributions, if not yet published in a journal, can be considered for the inclusion in the special issue.

The event is organized by GULP - Gruppo ricercatori e Utenti Logic Programming and all participants are required to be members of GULP.
