# Submission Guidelines

The Conference solicits two types of submissions:
- Full papers, even if already published in journals or in proceedings of other conferences
- Short papers, which are particularly suitable to present work in progress, software prototypes, extended abstracts of doctoral thesis, and general overviews of research projects.
{: .text-justify}

Contributions must be written in English, formatted using the CEURART style ([with the one-column option](https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html#CEURART)), and submitted in PDF format.
See CEUR author instructions for further details on how to prepare your submission.
{: .text-justify}

Full papers cannot exceed 15 pages including references. Short papers cannot exceed 8 pages including references. 
Non-original contributions should include a reference to the already published version of the paper (for instance in a footnote on the first page).
{: .text-justify}

Papers must be submitted via the [online submission system CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CILC2025).
{: .text-justify}

# Proceedings

Accepted original contributions will be included in a volume of the [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](https://ceur-ws.org/).<br>
Accepted non-original contributions will be given visibility on the conference web site including a link to the original publication, if available.
**For each paper accepted, at least one of the authors is required to make a senior registration (details will be available soon on the web site).**
{: .text-justify}

Following the CILC tradition, a selection of papers is planned to be published in a special issue of an international journal (to be determined). 
Extensions of accepted non-original contributions, if not yet published in a journal, can be considered for the inclusion in the special issue.
{: .text-justify}

The event is organized by GULP - Gruppo ricercatori e Utenti Logic Programming and all participants are required to be members of GULP.

### Formatting Guidelines

Please prepare your final manuscript using the official **[CEUR-ART LaTeX template](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip)**:
{: .text-justify }

- Set the document class using the following command:
  ```
  \documentclass{ceurart}
  ```
{: .text-justify }

- Immediately after `\begin{document}`, insert the following commands:
  ```
  \copyrightyear{2025}
  \copyrightclause{Copyright for this paper by its authors.
    Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).}
  \conference{CILC 2025: 40th Italian Conference on Computational Logic, June 25--27, 2025, Alghero, Italy}
  ```
{: .text-justify }

- **Do not** include page numbers, line numbers, or running headers in your manuscript.
{: .text-justify }

- Please use **emphasized capitalization** for the paper title and section headings. This means:
  - Capitalize all main words.
  - Do **not** capitalize articles (e.g., *a*, *an*, *the*), short prepositions (e.g., *in*, *of*, *on*, *by*), or coordinating conjunctions (e.g., *and*, *but*, *or*)—unless the word is the first or last word of the title, or follows a colon.
{: .text-justify }

### Submission Requirements

Via the CMT platform, authors are required to upload the following:
{: .text-justify }

1. A **signed copyright agreement** (see details below).  
2. The **final PDF** version of the camera-ready paper.  
3. An **editable version** of the manuscript:  
   - For LaTeX submissions: provide all relevant source files (`.tex`, `.bib`, figures, etc.), ideally packaged in a single `.zip` file.  
   - For Word or similar: submit the document in `.doc`, `.docx`, or `.odt` format.
{: .text-justify }

You may upload the files individually or bundled in a compressed archive.

### Copyright Agreement Forms

Please select and complete the appropriate form based on the content of your submission:
{: .text-justify }

- **AUTHOR-AGREEMENT (NTP)**  
  [Download here](https://cilc2025.github.io/assets/ceur-author-agreement-ccby-ntp-precompiled.pdf)  
  Use this form **if your paper contains no copyrighted third-party content** and  
  **was not generated using Generative AI tools**. This applies in most cases.
{: .text-justify }

- **AUTHOR-AGREEMENT (TP)**  
  [Download here](https://cilc2025.github.io/assets/ceur-author-agreement-ccby-tp-precompiled.pdf)  
  Use this form **if your paper includes third-party material** (e.g., figures, data, or text not originally authored by you),  
  or **was produced with the assistance of Generative AI tools**.
{: .text-justify }

  - In the case of third-party content, you must attach documented permission from the rights holders.  
  - If Generative AI tools were used, you must also complete and sign the **AI Statement** specifying what content was generated:  
    [Download AI Statement](https://ceur-ws.org/ceur-author-statement-AI-material.pdf?ver=2024-06-04)
{: .text-justify }

  Alternatively, if your manuscript includes the “Declaration on Generative AI” section (as defined in the latest CEURART template),  
  the separate AI Statement form is not required.
